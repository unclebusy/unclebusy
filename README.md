I am particularly passionate about developing user interfaces and their logical organization. I have well-developed skills of independent learning of new technologies, striving to find optimal solutions for tasks. Experience of working in teams using Agile/Scrum methodologies helps to interact effectively and achieve goals. I am constantly deepening my knowledge in my technology stack, as well as mastering new tools.
